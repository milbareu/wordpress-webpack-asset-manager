# WPAssets - WordPress Asset Manager

## Introduction

WPAssets is a PHP class designed to manage assets in WordPress. It integrates with Webpack's manifest.json and
entrypoints.json files, automatically enqueuing CSS, JS, and handling PHP dependencies in a structured and scalable way.
This streamlines asset management in WordPress themes and plugins.

## Features

- Automatic Asset Enqueuing: Easily enqueue JavaScript, CSS, and PHP files defined in Webpack's manifest.json.
- Bundle-Based Asset Management: Manage your assets by bundling them into logical entry points.
- Namespace Support: Add a custom namespace prefix to your assets for better organization.
- PHP Dependency Support: Automatically includes PHP files as part of the asset dependencies.

## Install via Composer

You can install WPAssets via Composer. Run the following command in your WordPress, theme or plugin directory:

```bash
composer require mb/wpassets
```

## 1. Enqueueing Assets in WordPress

To enqueue a bundle (which includes CSS, JS, and optionally PHP files), use the WPAssets::enqueueBundle() function.
This function pulls the required assets from the Webpack-generated manifest.json file.

```php
// Example: Enqueue the 'main' bundle with the namespace 'mytheme'
WPAssets::enqueueBundle('main', 'mytheme');

// Example: Enqueue the 'editor' bundle with the default namespace
WPAssets::enqueueBundle('editor');
```

## 2. Example Setup in functions.php

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use WPAssets in a WordPress theme to manage assets:

```php
<?php

use MB\WPAssets\WPAssets;

// Register the theme assets
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', function () {
    WPAssets::enqueueBundle('main', 'mytheme');
}, 100);

// Register assets for the block editor
add_action('enqueue_block_editor_assets', function () {
    WPAssets::enqueueBundle('editor');
}, 100);
```

### 2.1 Example Webpack Configuration

The example/ folder contains sample Webpack configuration files that you can adapt for your project. These
configurations support both production and development environments, allowing you to build optimized assets for each
scenario.

### 2.2 Environment-Based Build

Make sure your Webpack configuration supports environment-based builds. For example, you can define separate
configurations for development and production environments. These will generate different asset versions optimized for
each use case.

In your Webpack configuration files (see the example/ folder):

- **Development**: Generates source maps and unminified assets.
- **Production**: Minifies assets and removes unnecessary comments.

## 3. Webpack Manifest Structure

Your Webpack configuration should output a manifest.json with an entrypoints object. Below is a sample structure for
manifest.json:

```json
{
  "entrypoints": {
    "main": {
      "assets": {
        "css": [
          "/styles/main.css"
        ],
        "js": [
          "/scripts/main.js"
        ],
        "php": [
          "/scripts/main.asset.php"
        ]
      }
    },
    "editor": {
      "assets": {
        "css": [
          "/styles/editor.css"
        ],
        "js": [
          "/scripts/editor.js"
        ],
        "php": [
          "/scripts/editor.asset.php"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Function Reference

`enqueueBundle(string $entry, string $namespace = 'wpa')`
Enqueues the CSS, JS, and PHP files for a specified entry point.

- $entry: The name of the entry point (e.g., 'main', 'editor').
- $namespace (optional): A prefix for the asset handles (default is 'wpa').

Example:

```php
WPAssets::enqueueBundle('main', 'mytheme');
```

`getAsset(string $assetName, bool $getContents = false): ?string`

Retrieves the URL or content of a single asset based on its name.

- $assetName: The name of the asset (e.g., 'main.css', 'main.js').
- $getContents: Whether to return the content of the file (true) or the URL (false).

Example:

```php
$mainCssUrl = WPAssets::getAsset('main.css'); // Get URL of main.css
```

`getAssetDependencies(string $entry): array`

Retrieves the asset dependencies from the corresponding .asset.php file for a given entry.

- $entry: The entry name (e.g., 'main.js').

Example:

```php
$deps = WPAssets::getAssetDependencies('main.js');
```

## 5. Advanced Usage

To include specific PHP files from your Webpack configuration, ensure they are listed in the php key under the
corresponding entry point in manifest.json. These files will be automatically included using include_once when the
bundle is enqueued.

Example:

```json
"php": [
"/scripts/main.asset.php"
]
```
